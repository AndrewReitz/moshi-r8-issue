= Moshi R8 Issue

Run the app and it will crash because moshi's KotlinJsonAdapterFactory will not be able to find the constructor
of the Test class.

The solution appears to be to add this to the proguard-rules.pro file.

```
-keep class kotlin.Metadata {
    *;
}

-keep class com.example.myapplication.Test {
    *;
}
```

Trying to keep just the `Metadata` and the classes constructor did work, and for some reason the entire model class
needs to be kept.
